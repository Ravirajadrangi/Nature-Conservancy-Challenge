# Kaggle Nature Conservancy Challenge

This repository contains my efforts for the Kaggle Nature Conservancy Challenge. Some of the work are linked from other Kaggler's repositories.

## Files
 - shiny_annotater.R contains a simple web-based shiny app for annotating images. It reads and writes to markers.csv, my personal annotations record
 - train.csv contains the 'merged' annotations from my markers.csv file and [nathaniel's annotations](https://github.com/nathanie/kaggleNatureConservancy)
 - Fish.ipynb contains the exploration and explanation behind the way I wrote my code. A functional 'productionalized' script will be released once the model and exploration has proved stable.
